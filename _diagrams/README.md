The diagrams were generated using the [Railroad-diagram Generator](https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams) project.

The version used was [c2348c5a63e15fe1d4ec78f8dcb8d09a05268ad1](https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams/commit/c2348c5a63e15fe1d4ec78f8dcb8d09a05268ad1).

Steps to Generate:
   1. clone the [Railroad-diagram Generator](https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams)
   2. replace `railroad-diagrams.css` with the version in this directory
   3. open `generator.html` in a browser, and paste in each diagram from the `*.js` files
   4. use the [Snipping Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipping_Tool) or another screen capture tool to copy the resulting diagram
   5. use an editor like [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/) to clean up and save as png
   
Clean up done with graphics editor:
   * some lines had lighter section artifacts from where elements joined
   * some diagrams positioned items strangely horizontally and were shifted left
   * added labels to string diagram (Arial 12pt italic)
   * on the date/time diagram, the sign of the time zone offset must be adjusted to require a '`+`' or '`-`'
